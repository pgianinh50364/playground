### Steps to Perform A/B Testing

#### 1. Define the Objective and Hypothesis
- **What to Do**: Clearly state what you’re testing and why. Define the metric(s) you’ll measure (e.g., click-through rate, user engagement time, revenue).
- **Details**:
    - **Objective**: Improve a specific outcome (e.g., increase time spent on a video platform).
    - **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: There’s no difference between the control (current version) and treatment (new version) (e.g.,  $\mu_{\text{control}} = \mu_{\text{treatment}}$​).
    - **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The treatment improves the metric (e.g., $\mu_{\text{treatment}} > \mu_{\text{control}}$​).
- **Example**: Test if a new recommendation algorithm increases average watch time per user. $H_0$​: No change in watch time; $H_1$: New algorithm increases watch time.
- **Tip**: Ensure the metric aligns with business goals and is measurable.

#### 2. Identify the Control and Treatment
- **What to Do**: Decide what’s being compared.
    - **Control (Group A)**: The current version (e.g., existing algorithm).
    - **Treatment (Group B)**: The new version (e.g., modified algorithm).
- **Details**:
    - Make one change at a time to isolate its effect (e.g., don’t change the algorithm and UI simultaneously).
    - Ensure both versions are stable and bug-free.
- **Example**: Control = current video recommendation algorithm; Treatment = new algorithm with personalized suggestions.
- **Tip**: Document the exact differences to avoid confusion later.

#### 3. Determine the Sample Size
- **What to Do**: Calculate how many users (or observations) you need in each group to detect a meaningful difference.
- **Details**:
    - Use a **power calculation** to find the sample size based on:
        - **Effect Size**: The minimum difference you want to detect (e.g., 5% increase in watch time).
        - **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**: Typically 0.05 (5% chance of Type I error).
        - **Power ($1 - \beta$)**: Typically 0.8 (80% chance of detecting the effect).
        - **Baseline Variance**: Estimated from historical data (e.g., variance in watch time).
    - Formula for two-sample t-test (approximate): $$n \approx \frac{2 (\sigma^2) (z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})^2}{\delta^2}$$ Where:
        - $\sigma^2$: Variance of the metric.
        - $\delta$: Effect size (difference in means).
        - $z_{1-\alpha/2}, z_{1-\beta}$: Z-scores for significance and power.
    - Use online calculators or tools like `statsmodels` in Python for precision.
- **Example**: If historical watch time has $\sigma = 3$  minutes, you want to detect a 0.5-minute increase $\delta = 0.5$), with $\alpha = 0.05$, power = 0.8, you’d need ~142 users per group.
- **Tip**: Larger samples improve precision but increase costs/time. Balance practicality and statistical needs.

#### 4. Randomize and Split the Sample
- **What to Do**: Assign users randomly to control or treatment groups to avoid bias.
- **Details**:
    - Use a random number generator or hashing (e.g., user ID modulo 2) for assignment.
    - Ensure groups are balanced in size (e.g., 50/50 split) or justify uneven splits.
    - Check for confounding factors (e.g., time of day, user demographics) and stratify if needed.
- **Example**: Randomly assign 10,000 users to control (5,000) and treatment (5,000) based on user IDs.
- **Tip**: Verify randomization by comparing baseline metrics (e.g., age, prior engagement) across groups.

#### 5. Choose the Statistical Test
- **What to Do**: Select a test to analyze results, based on data characteristics and assumptions (as per the article).
- **Details**:
    - **Consider Data Distribution**:
        - Normal data: Use Student’s t-test (equal variances) or Welch’s t-test (unequal variances).
        - Skewed data (e.g., watch time, revenue): Use Mann-Whitney U or log-transformed t-test.
        - Non-standard metrics or small samples: Use bootstrap or permutation tests.
        - Large samples: Z-test may suffice.
        - Entire distributions: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (less common).
    - **Metric Type**:
        - Continuous (e.g., time): T-tests, Mann-Whitney U.
        - Proportions (e.g., click rates): Chi-squared or z-test for proportions.
    - **Example from Article**: For watch time (often skewed), Mann-Whitney U or log-transformed t-test is robust; for normal data, Welch’s t-test is reliable.
- **Example**: If watch time is log-normal, plan to use a Mann-Whitney U test or log-transform for a t-test.
- **Tip**: Pre-analyze historical data to understand its distribution (e.g., histogram, skewness).

#### 6. Run the Experiment
- **What to Do**: Launch the test, exposing users to control or treatment versions, and collect data.
- **Details**:
    - **Duration**: Run long enough to capture stable behavior (e.g., 1-2 weeks to account for weekly patterns).
    - **Consistency**: Avoid external changes (e.g., holidays, other experiments) that could skew results.
    - **Data Collection**: Log the metric for each user (e.g., watch time per session).
    - **Monitoring**: Check for issues (e.g., bugs, extreme outliers) during the test.
- **Example**: Run the new algorithm for 14 days, logging daily watch time for 5,000 users per group.
- **Tip**: Use a dashboard to monitor key metrics in real-time to catch anomalies early.

#### 7. Analyze the Results
- **What to Do**: Apply the chosen statistical test to determine if the treatment outperforms the control.
- **Details**:
    - **Compute Descriptive Statistics**:
        - Means, medians, variances for both groups.
        - Visualize data (e.g., histograms, boxplots) to check assumptions (normality, outliers).
    - **Run the Test**:
        - Calculate the test statistic and p-value.
        - Example (Welch’s t-test): $$t = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2}}}$$Where $\bar{X}, \bar{Y}$ are group means, $s_X^2, s_Y^2$ are variances.
    - **Interpret P-Value**:
        - If $p < \alpha$ (e.g., 0.05), reject $H_0$​, concluding the treatment has a significant effect.
        - If $p \geq \alpha$, fail to reject $H_0$​.
    - **Effect Size**: Calculate the practical significance (e.g., Cohen’s d, percentage increase). $$d = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y}}{s_p}, \quad s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_X^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_Y^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}$$
    - **Check Assumptions**: For t-tests, verify normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test); for Mann-Whitney U, ensure similar distribution shapes.
- **Example**: If control mean watch time is 10 minutes, treatment is 10.5, with $p = 0.03$ from Welch’s t-test, conclude the new algorithm significantly increases watch time.
- **Tip**: Use robust tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney U) if assumptions are violated.

#### 8. Validate and Interpret Results
- **What to Do**: Ensure the results are trustworthy and actionable.
- **Details**:
    - **Sanity Checks**:
        - Confirm randomization worked (e.g., similar demographics).
        - Check for external biases (e.g., server issues affecting one group).
    - **Multiple Testing**: If testing multiple metrics or variants, adjust for false positives (e.g., Bonferroni correction:  $\alpha' = \alpha / k$ , where $k$ is the number of tests).
    - **Practical Significance**: A statistically significant result may not matter if the effect is tiny (e.g., 0.01-minute increase).
    - **Segment Analysis**: Explore if effects vary by subgroup (e.g., new vs. returning users).
- **Example**: If $p = 0.03$, but the increase is only 0.1 minutes, weigh whether it’s worth implementing.
- **Tip**: Document findings clearly, including p-values, effect sizes, and confidence intervals.

#### 9. Make a Decision
- **What to Do**: Decide whether to adopt the treatment, keep the control, or iterate.
- **Details**:
    - **If Significant and Meaningful**: Roll out the treatment (e.g., deploy the new algorithm).
    - **If Not Significant**: Retain the control or redesign the treatment.
    - **If Mixed Results**: Consider further tests (e.g., tweak the algorithm, test on a different segment).
- **Example**: If the new algorithm increases watch time by 5% ($p<0.05$), implement it; if $p = 0.2$, stick with the current algorithm.
- **Tip**: Consider costs, risks, and long-term impacts (e.g., user retention).

#### 10. Document and Share Results
- **What to Do**: Record the experiment’s details and communicate findings to stakeholders.
- **Details**:
    - Include: Objective, hypothesis, sample size, duration, test used, p-value, effect size, visualizations, and conclusions.
    - Highlight actionable insights and next steps.
    - Share with relevant teams (e.g., product, engineering) to inform future decisions.
- **Example**: Create a report stating: “New algorithm increased watch time by 0.5 minutes (p = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.2). Recommend full rollout.”
- **Tip**: Store results in a centralized system to build institutional knowledge.

#### 11. Monitor Post-Implementation (If Applicable)
- **What to Do**: Track the metric after rolling out the winner to ensure sustained performance.
- **Details**:
    - Compare post-rollout data to A/B test results.
    - Watch for unintended consequences (e.g., decreased retention despite increased watch time).
    - Be ready to revert if issues arise.
- **Example**: After deploying the new algorithm, monitor watch time weekly to confirm the 0.5-minute gain holds.
- **Tip**: Set up alerts for significant drops in key metrics.

### Additional Considerations
- **Ethical Testing**: Ensure the treatment doesn’t harm users (e.g., avoid manipulative features).
- **Data Quality**: Clean data to remove outliers or errors (e.g., negative watch times).
- **Test Duration**: Account for novelty effects (users initially liking a new feature) or learning curves.
- **Tooling**: Use platforms like Optimizely, Google Optimize, or custom scripts for implementation and analysis.
- **Article Insight**: The article emphasizes choosing a test based on data distribution (e.g., Mann-Whitney U for skewed watch time). Always inspect data first (e.g., histogram) to guide test selection.
